# Fraud-Detection-Assistant
This Python script simulates a rule-based fraud detection assistant tailored for Indian users. It begins by displaying a header with student details, then prompts the user to input a series of transaction details such as amount, location, and merchant. For each transaction, it applies a simple fraud detection rule: if the amount exceeds â‚¹10,000 and the location is not among trusted Indian cities, it is flagged as suspicious. The chatbot provides real-time feedback by printing either a fraud alert or a normal transaction confirmation. This interactive terminal-based chatbot helps demonstrate basic fraud detection logic without using machine learning. It's ideal for educational or prototype purposes.
